/**Comment Your JavaScript Code
Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave 
notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.
There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript.
NOTE: As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. 
Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others and for your future self.
Try creating one of each type of comment. */
