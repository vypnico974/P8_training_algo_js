/**Nest one Array within Another Array
You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

Create a nested array called myArray. */
// Only change code below this line
const myArray = [["array1", 1], ["array2", 2]];
